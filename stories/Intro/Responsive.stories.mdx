# Responsive styles

styled-minimal offers a convenient shorthand syntax for adding responsive styles with a
mobile-first approach. While this syntax can seem odd at first, it can become a powerful way to
manage responsive typography and layouts.

```jsx
// responsive width
<Box
  width={{
    _: 1, // The base value
    md: 1 / 2, // 50% on medium screen sizes and up
    xl: 1 / 4, // 25% on extra large screen sizes and up
  }}
/>

// responsive font size (using the theme's fontSizes scale)
<Box
  fontSize={{
    _: 3,
    md: 4,
    lg: 26, /* numbers that don't exist in the scale will be converted to px */
    xl: '5rem'
  }}
/>


// responsive padding (using the theme's space scale)
<Box
  padding={{
    _: 3,
    md: 4,
  }}
/>

```

With arrays

```jsx
<Box
  width={[
    1,    // 100% below the smallest breakpoint
    1/2,  // 50% from the next breakpoint and up (xs)
    null, // use the previous value (sm)
    1/4   // 25% from the next breakpoint and up (md)
  ]}
/>

// responsive margin (using the theme's space scale)
<Box m={[ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]} />
```
